                    <br>Movements that strengthen and condition the muscles in your eye structure. Improve vision, treat
                    symptoms of dry eye, and decrease eye strain.



                    <br>NECK exercises

                    <br>For better blood flow to brain and help maintain serotonin levels.

                    <br>(Serotonin is the key hormone that stabilizes our mood, feelings of well-being, and happiness.
                    It also helps with sleeping, eating, and digestion.)



                    <br>BALANCING exercises

                    <br>The physical benefits are strength, stability, coordination and improved posture. Off the mat,
                    balance asanas helps in relieving stress and reducing inner tension. Also, they improve focus,
                    concentration and memory.



                    <br>POSTURE exercises When one is stronger & more flexible, posture improves. Yoga poses to develop
                    core strength, since one needs core muscles to support & maintain each pose. With a stronger core,
                    one is more likely to sit & stand "tall." Yoga also helps in body awareness.



                    <br>PRANAYAMA

                    <br>The exercise balances the right and left sides of the brain and body, and can be used to calm
                    and bring a sense of clarity to an overstimulated mind.



                    <br>TRATAK MEDITATION

                    <br>Better focus & concentration, improved self-awareness & self-esteem, lower levels of stress and
                    anxiety.

                    <br>Although yoga is considered a safe type of exercise, everybody is different, so it's crucial to
                    talk to your healthcare practitioner to get to know better ways to achieve your goals. Yoga during
                    pregnancy aids in the development of physical strength and flexibility, the development of balance
                    and coordination, the enhancement of circulation, and the promotion of relaxation.
